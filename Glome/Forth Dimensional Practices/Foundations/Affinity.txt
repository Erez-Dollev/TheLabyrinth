like the destiguish ["resonance","Resonance.txt"] of particles that gives each its own nature,
affinity is the natural resonance of a consciousness that gives it it's destinguished personality and traits.

Affinity is the defence mechanism of ["consciousness","Conciated Beings.txt"]. If attacked by strong external influence that can destroy it,
a consciated being will resonate against it to resist the destructive forces. Affinity is the default ["anchor","Anchor.txt"] of each living being.
