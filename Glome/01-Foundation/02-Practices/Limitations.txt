There are numerous limitation that correlates to the ["practices","Resonance Practices"] of resonance.
If ones beaks his limits, he might lose control and die.

Control - is the most important one. If one loses control over his resonance, he might torbulate into chaos, and that stretches the strenght and speed limitations.

Strength - to resonate over the strength limit directly harms the bodyrealms, causing them to freacture and breakdown.

Speed - speed wears down the ["constitution","Constitution.txt"] factor, the faster one's resonates the lower his constitution gets. Eventaully, speed breaks down the bodyrealms.
